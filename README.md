Coupon Management System

Academic Systems Programming Project (Java, Spring Boot)

Designed and implemented a full Coupon Management System developed in two phases, progressing from low-level systems programming to modern backend architecture.

Phase 1 – Core Systems Programming

Built the system core using Java, OOP, JDBC, and MySQL, focusing on clean architecture and system-level design.

Designed a relational database schema (Companies, Customers, Coupons, Categories, Purchases)

Implemented DAO layer for full CRUD operations

Used Facade pattern to separate business logic by role (Admin, Company, Customer)

Implemented Singleton-based Connection Pool for efficient database access

Developed a multithreaded daily job that automatically removes expired coupons

Created a centralized login mechanism with role-based access

Built a full test flow simulating real system usage
